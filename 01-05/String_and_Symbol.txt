Strings
.chop -> new_str) returns a new string with the last character removed.
if the string ends in \r\n both characters are removed instead of
just the last character. example: "Hello".chop == "Hell"

.dump -> new_str) returns a new version of your string with all non-printing
replaced by \nnn notation and all special characters expired. Non-printable charcters
are defined as such: based on the English alphabet, it encodes 128 specified
characters into 7-bit binary intergers.

Symbols
sym == obj -> True or False
Equality if the symbol and the object are the exact same then returns true.
This is different from the String method since the Symbol and the object must be
the same and not just similar.

to_proc
returns a Proc object which respond to the given method by sym.

Enumerable Class
collect_concat{|obj|block}-> array
collect_concast -> an_enumerator
Returns with a new array with concatenated results of running block once for
every element in enum. You would probably use this for tax forms maybe, or even finding
the percentages of return investment over the years.
